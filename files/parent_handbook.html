      <button class="accordion"><h2>Daily Schedule</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Classes at WUNS run in either the morning or afternoon, from 8:50AM-11:45AM or 12:30PM-3:15PM respectively.</p>
        <h4>Extended Day Option</h4>
        <p>
          The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities
          for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who
          attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but
          perhaps not full-day schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.,
          for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30
          p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for
          participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear
          Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are
          designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on
          learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement
          or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one
          day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any
          particular week.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress
          children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and
          creative curriculum. Children must be toilet-trained to enroll in Bear
          Tracks.

      <button class="accordion"><h2>Home-School Communication</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <h4>Parent-Staff Communication</h4>
        <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.</p>
        <h4>Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</h4>
        <p>Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers
        keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion"><h2>Orientation</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year.
        The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion"><h2>Getting Extra Help</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
        an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
        meet students’ needs.</p>
        <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
        of ways, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
          process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
          <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
          <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
          order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
          <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
          concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><h2>Discipline</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.</p>
        <p>The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.</p>
        <p>Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:
          <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
            <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
            <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings.</li>
            <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
            <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><h2>Special Events</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <h4>School Picnic</h4>
        <p>Families are invited to a school gathering at the beginning and end of the school year. “Popsicles at the Park” is held the week prior to school starting. This fun family event at Shaw Park allows children and parents to get acquainted with new classmates and their teachers. The last week of school families gather for a dinner/potluck at Shaw Park to celebrate the culmination of the year.</p>
        <h4>Open House</h4>
        <p>In October, WUNS holds an “open house” for current children and their families. This event allows parents and siblings to visit the child’s classroom, meet the teachers and play on the playground. Children are excited to “show-off” their school to their family.</p>
        <h4>After-school Playdates</h4>
        <p>We arrange times throughout the year to have the WUNS playground open after school from 3:15-5:00 p.m. so children and their families can play. Siblings are welcome to join. All children must have a parent or caregiver present to attend.</p>
        <h4>Halloween Parade</h4>
        <p>Parents are invited to our annual Halloween parade followed by songs and snack in their child’s classroom. An invitation and details will be shared with all parents.</p>
        <h4>Donuts with Dads and Muffins with Moms</h4>
        <p>Parents are invited to enjoy time to play in the classroom and a special snack with their preschoolers during these special days (fall and spring). Children will bring home invitations and details about each event.</p>
        <h4>Dine Out Nights</h4>
        <p>The Nursery School partners with local restaurants to provide social gatherings for families. On these Dine Out Nights, families and friends are encouraged to eat out at the designated restaurant. Families enjoy having a meal with fellow WUNS classmates and parents, while also supporting the Nursery School.</p>
        <h4>Night at the Magic House</h4>
        <p>In February, the Nursery School rents the early childhood section of the Magic House for Nursery School families. This special night is a huge hit with everyone. Parents can enjoy a private night at their child’s favorite hands-on museum!</p>
        <h4>Annual Parent Social</h4>
        <p>In early spring, parents are invited to a “parent-only” social event. In the past it has been a trivia night, gallery night (highlighting preschooler’s artwork), and/or silent auction. Monies raised help support our enrichment programs – Art, Spanish, Nature and Music, as well as specific equipment or school needs.</p>
