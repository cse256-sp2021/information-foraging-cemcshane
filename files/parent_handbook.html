      <button class="accordion"><h2>Discipline</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.</p>
        <p>The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.</p>
        <p>Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:
          <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
            <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
            <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings.</li>
            <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
            <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.</p>

            The	nursery	school	makes	a	great	effort	to	provide	a	healthy	environment	for	your	children.		
            We	work	diligently	on	forming	healthy	habits	such	as	washing	hands	before	eating	or	
            handling	food,	and	after	toileting.		Our	dishes	and	cups	are	put	through	a	dishwasher/	
            sanitizer	to	sterilize	them	and	to	prevent	the	spread	of	germs.		The	rooms	are	thoroughly	
            12 cleaned	daily	and	checked	for	safety.		However,	despite	everyone’s	best	efforts,	children	and	
            adults	will	get	sick.		It	is	an	expected	part	of	life.		If	children	become	ill	at	school,	they	will	be	
            cared	for	in	the	office	until	a	parent	can	pick	them	up.	
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents	are	requested	to	keep	their	child	home	in	the	event	of	the	diseases	or	symptoms	
            noted	below.		The	child	will	be	allowed	to	return	to	school	when	he	or	she	has	been	free	of	
            these	symptoms	and	has	not	required	medication	for	a	minimum	of	24	hours.		If	a	symptom	
            persists	(such	as	rash	or	cough),	or	if	a	communicable	disease	is	confirmed	(measles,	chicken	
            pox,	etc.),	returning	to	school	may	require	a	statement	from	the	child’s	physician	declaring	
            that	the	condition	is	no	longer	contagious.		
          </p>
          <p>
            PLEASE	CALL	the	nursery	school	to	inform	us	that	your	child	is	sick,	especially	if	he/	she	has	
            a	communicable	disease.		Communicable diseases	or	conditions	include: strep throat, chicken pox, measles,
            mumps, impetigo, conjunctivitis,
            hepatitis	A, diarrheal diseases, lice,
            scabies, pinworm, ringworm, and 
            certain	other	viral	or	bacterial	infections.
          </p>
          <p>
            If	your	child	is	exposed	to	or	contracts	a	communicable	disease,	it	is	essential	that	you call	
            the	nursery	school	to	tell	us.		In	turn,	we	will	send	a	letter	home	to	inform	parents	that	your	
            child	has	been	exposed	to	a	communicable	disease.
