            <h1>Daily Hours</h1>
            <h3>Classes at WUNS run in either the morning or afternoon, from 8:50AM-11:45AM or 12:30PM-3:15PM respectively.</h3>
            <h4>Extended Day Option</h4>
            <p>
              The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities
              for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who
              attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but
              perhaps not full-day schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.,
              for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30
              p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for
              participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.
            </p>

              In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear
              Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are
              designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on
              learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement
              or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one
              day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any
              particular week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress
              children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and
              creative curriculum. Children must be toilet-trained to enroll in Bear
              Tracks.
