        <h4>Parent-Staff Communication</h4>
        <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion"><h2>Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers
        keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.</p>

        <h3>Parent Association</h3>
        <p>
          The parent organization for the Washington University Nursery School
          allows parents to become better acquainted with other parents and
          children, build a stronger sense of community and raise funds for
          “extras.”
        <p>
        <p>
          Any parent of a student at the nursery school is automatically a
          member. You can help by attending one of our meetings or contacting
          the parent association school coordinator, Amber Ott, at (314)
          935-6689. Our family events are listed on the school

        <h4>School Picnic</h4>
        <p>Families are invited to a school gathering at the beginning and end of the school year. “Popsicles at the Park” is held the week prior to school starting. This fun family event at Shaw Park allows children and parents to get acquainted with new classmates and their teachers. The last week of school families gather for a dinner/potluck at Shaw Park to celebrate the culmination of the year.</p>
        <h4>Open House</h4>
        <p>In October, WUNS holds an “open house” for current children and their families. This event allows parents and siblings to visit the child’s classroom, meet the teachers and play on the playground. Children are excited to “show-off” their school to their family.</p>
        <h4>After-school Playdates</h4>
        <p>We arrange times throughout the year to have the WUNS playground open after school from 3:15-5:00 p.m. so children and their families can play. Siblings are welcome to join. All children must have a parent or caregiver present to attend.</p>
        <h4>Halloween Parade</h4>
        <p>Parents are invited to our annual Halloween parade followed by songs and snack in their child’s classroom. An invitation and details will be shared with all parents.</p>
        <h4>Donuts with Dads and Muffins with Moms</h4>
        <p>Parents are invited to enjoy time to play in the classroom and a special snack with their preschoolers during these special days (fall and spring). Children will bring home invitations and details about each event.</p>
        <h4>Dine Out Nights</h4>
        <p>The Nursery School partners with local restaurants to provide social gatherings for families. On these Dine Out Nights, families and friends are encouraged to eat out at the designated restaurant. Families enjoy having a meal with fellow WUNS classmates and parents, while also supporting the Nursery School.</p>
        <h4>Night at the Magic House</h4>
        <p>In February, the Nursery School rents the early childhood section of the Magic House for Nursery School families. This special night is a huge hit with everyone. Parents can enjoy a private night at their child’s favorite hands-on museum!</p>
        <h4>Annual Parent Social</h4>
        <p>In early spring, parents are invited to a “parent-only” social event. In the past it has been a trivia night, gallery night (highlighting preschooler’s artwork), and/or silent auction. Monies raised help support our enrichment programs – Art, Spanish, Nature and Music, as well as specific equipment or school needs.</p>

      <!-- <h1>Get Involved</h1>
      <h2>
        Washington University Nursery School recognizes that parents are a
        child’s first and most influential teachers. In light of these
        important relationships, we like to partner with parents and
        grandparents, childcare providers and special friends by coordinating
        several special events throughout the year.
      </h2>
      <p>
        For specific dates of special events, see the

        <p>
          Open House is a time for our students to show family their indoor
          and outdoor learning spaces: the classrooms and playground. Open
          House is held for a few hours on a Saturday or Sunday in October.
          Families are encouraged to stop by at some point during the Open
          House event. This is also a great opportunity for families to meet
          other families within the school.

        <p>
          Family Play Dates are held two or three times each semester on the
          playground from 3:15 p.m. – 5 p.m. Siblings and snacks are welcome.
          Play dates provide another opportunity to meet other families from

      <h3>Family Night at the Magic House</h3>
      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Each year the nursery school rents out the Magic House for a winter
          night of fun from 6-8 p.m. WUNS families and friends have the Magic
          House all to themselves. Children often remark that it is their
          favorite event of the year!

        <p>
          Once each semester, the classrooms have a special celebration for
          families and friends. We invite dads and granddads in the fall and
          moms and grandmoms in the spring. Of course, any special friend is
          invited, and we are very flexible about who attends each semester.
          The children may prepare a special snack, perform a song or dance or
          simply enjoy time in their classroom with their special visitor.
          These events take place during the school day and last approximately
          one hour.

          costumes if they feel comfortable. Family and friends are welcome to
          attend. The event lasts about an hour during both the morning and
          afternoon classes. See the

        <p>
          Room parents are encouraged to organize a parent-only or
          child-parent event for their particular classroom. In the past, room
          parents have planned gatherings, such as a cocktail happy hour or a
          potluck play date at a park.

          Every spring, the room parents organize a fundraiser and social
          gathering for adults. Trivia night, gallery night and progressive
          dinners are just a few things that have been fun successes in the
          past.

      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Each year, we open and close our school year with picnics at Shaw
          Park. Under one of the pavilions, families and staff enjoy a
          barbeque potluck. The spacious and well-built play space next to the
          pavilion keeps the children entertained. Teachers and staff
          especially love seeing our school’s alumni join their siblings at
          the picnics.

      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Each classroom picks one day to provide a lunch for our classroom
          teachers and Washington University student assistants. Families
          volunteer at the beginning of the year, and each room parent helps
          organize the lunch. Our teachers greatly enjoy this gesture of
          appreciation.
