          <h4>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h4>
          <p>¡Hola! (Hello!) de Señora Colleen (from Miss Colleen)</p>
          <p>
            I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish enrichment
            program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is to keep it fun,
            simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song, props, games or
            movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and simple phrases in
            memorable ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for
            songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the
            vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview
            of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to
            certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

          <h4>Nature on the Move with Miss Becky</h4>
          <p>
            I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that has
            been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to preserve
            our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of our society
            to love and respect the natural world around them. Nature on the Move
            allows children to get up close to Missouri’s wildlife and learn how
            each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit
            WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.

      <button class="accordion"><h2>Fine Arts</h2></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
          themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
          important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
          process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
          manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
          successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
          or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
          strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and
          experiences include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
          and items</li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
          <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
          <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of threedimensional items</li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
          recyclable materials</li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring visual arts, music and drama
          with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their
          everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground.</p>

        <h4>Art with Miss Suzy</h4>
        <p>
          <a class="download" href="downloads/WUNS-announcement-ART.pdf" target="_blank">Letter from Ms. Suzy about WUNS
            Art Enrichment</a><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
          Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
          each month and build understanding through conversations and
          experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
          home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
          of Art.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
          since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
          the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
          and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
          each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
          personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!
        </p>
        <h4>Music with Ms. Christina</h4>
        <p>
          I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
          year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
          taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
          teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
          variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
          have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
          music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
          make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
          that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
          a Big Bear and Sun Bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
          songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
          children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
          classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
          voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
          instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
          create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
          tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
          fun!

        meet students’ needs.</p>
        <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
        of ways, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
          process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
          <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
          <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
          students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
          group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
          informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
          and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
          Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
          curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
          child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
          read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting</p>
